QuackTrack
Inspiration
QuackTrack is designed to help college students navigate the job search process. We’ve faced many challenges ourselves, and we wanted to create a tool that guides users through finding the right job, improving their resumes, and preparing for interviews.

What it does
QuackTrack uses AI to analyze your resume and match you with the best job listings via the Empllo API. It refines results based on your job preferences and guides you on how to apply. The app also simulates both behavioral and technical interviews and offers feedback on how to improve.

How we built it
We used React and Node.js for the frontend, creating five interactive pages. On the backend, a Flask app in Python scrapes job listings from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed, while also generating mock interview questions and job-specific roadmaps.

Challenges
Unifying the frontend styles was challenging, as two developers had different approaches. It took extra time to align the code and create a consistent design.

Accomplishments
We’re proud of the features we implemented in a short time, including job-matching, interview simulation, and personalized feedback.

What we learned
Each team member learned a new skill—two of us worked with React for the first time, and the other two gained experience with Flask.

What's next
We aim to enhance resume suggestions and improve AI-driven recommendations for student success with more data.
